📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

I recently completed an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project on a retail sales dataset to extract meaningful insights from customer transactions and product performance.

🔎 What I Did:

Performed data cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing

Analyzed monthly sales trends using line plots

Explored category-wise and gender-wise sales distribution

Visualized age distribution and customer behavior

Created correlation heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots

Discovered relationships between quantity sold and total revenue

📊 Key Insights:

Identified top-performing product categories

Highlighted sales contribution by gender and age group

Observed seasonal trends and spikes in customer purchases

Revealed strong correlations between sales and product quantity

👉 This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in EDA, data visualization, and generating actionable business insights from raw data.
